- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Kabocha-san
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in way too much stuff for my own good to be honest.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning python. I have messed arround with other languages in the past but this is the first time time I am learning how to code  properly (I hope at least).

I speak English, German and Japanese.

Obviously since I am just learning how to code properly (at this point my abilities are at least nearing the mediocre, I think), once I actually publish something more worthwhile my code might be (somewhat?) inefficient, messy and or unelegant or whatever, sorry about that in advance. I guess that is just something to be fixed in time, but that is after all what learning is.

As already stated in my bio I am physically disabled and might be absent and not able to respond for longer amounts of time depending on what my health just decides to do, so development on my repos might get stalled, slow down for some time as well. Otherwise I am also usually busy studying.

My avater is ai generated.
