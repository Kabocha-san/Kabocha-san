- 🦎️ Hi, I’m the pumpkin.
- 👀 I’m interested in way too much stuff for my own good to be honest.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python. I have messed arround with other languages in the past but this is the first time time I am learning how to code (I hope at least) properly.

I speak English, German and Japanese (my understanding is far, far better than my production; but I can still communicate in Japanese well enough).

It  has not been all too long since I properly learned to code my skills are at this point at least intermmediate.

I am also usually busy studying (if my health allows it).

As already stated in my bio I am physically disabled and might be absent and not able to respond for longer amounts of time depending on what my health just decides to do, so development on my repos might get stalled or slow down for some time as well. Otherwise I am also usually busy studying.

My avater is ai generated

For now there is not too much to see here yet.

My username is (obviously) meant to be a pun.
